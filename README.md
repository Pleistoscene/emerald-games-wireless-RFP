## 1. About Us
Emerald Games is a small gaming company I started. My first game, *The Last Conflict*, was released on Steam in 2017. Getting that game on Steam was my first big goal — and I did it. Now, my goal is to help other indie developers reach their goals too, just like I did. As our team grows, we need a solid wireless setup in the office that’s secure, fast, and can handle everything we throw at it.

## 2. Project Scope

This project is about setting up a good wireless network for the office at Emerald Games. We want something that works well, is secure, and can handle lots of people using it at once — especially since we’re a game company and use heavy internet stuff all the time.

### Objectives
- Get solid wireless coverage everywhere in the office
- Use up-to-date tech like Wi-Fi 6
- Keep it secure so only the right people can connect
- Make sure it can handle lots of devices at the same time
- Set up tools so we can check the network and fix stuff fast

### Scope of Work
- **Site Survey** – Walk through the office and figure out where to put the Wi-Fi access points so there’s no dead zones
- **Install & Setup** – Mount the access points and get them working with our settings (SSID, password, etc.)
- **Connect to Wired Network** – Make sure everything connects to the network we already have (LAN switches, router, etc.)
- **Security Setup** – Use WPA3, turn on MAC address filtering, and set up a guest Wi-Fi if needed
- **Test Everything** – Try out the network to make sure the speed is good and there are no weak spots
- **Basic Documentation** – Write down the setup in case someone needs to look at it later
- **Maintenance** – Keep the system updated and fix any issues that come up after installation

---

## 3. Requirements

- **Full Coverage** – Wi-Fi should reach all the rooms like offices, meeting areas, and open spaces
- **Wi-Fi 6 Support** – Must support the newest Wi-Fi standard so newer devices get full speed
- **Good Security** – Needs to have WPA3, MAC filtering, and maybe a separate network for guests
- **Handles Lots of Devices** – Should work fine with 100+ devices at once without slowing down
- **Monitoring Tools** – We need a way to see who’s connected, if anything’s wrong, and get alerts if stuff breaks

---

## 4. Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Technicians must provide a list of operating systems they know how to work with (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)

### Security & Compliance Requirements
- **Network Security** – List the Wi-Fi equipment you'd use (like Ubiquiti, Cisco, etc.) and a sample config (like how you set up SSIDs, VLANs, etc.)
- **Endpoint Security** – Share how you’ll protect the connected devices (firewalls, antivirus, etc.)
- **Data Protection** – Show how user and guest data will be safe (encryption, secure storage, etc.)
- **Regulations** – Follow GDPR, HIPAA, and any rules that apply to user data and privacy
- **Audits & Reporting** – Run regular checks and share reports on how secure everything is

---

## 5. Vendor Qualifications

### Experience
- Vendors should have at least 2 years of experience setting up wireless networks in office environments
- Vendors should be able to provide examples of past work that shows technical knowledge and ability to solve problems

### Project Approach
- Vendors should include 2 example projects they’ve worked on or ideas they would suggest for improving wireless networks in game development or tech-focused offices

### Certifications
- Vendors must have at least one current certification in networking or security (e.g., CCNA, Network+, CWNA, or similar)
- Additional certifications in wireless, security, or cloud services are considered a plus

### References
- Vendors must provide at least 3 references from past clients who had similar wireless or network projects
