# Request for Proposal (RFP)
## Deployment of Wireless Infrastructure
**Submitted by:** Aaron Queskekapow  
**Company:** Emerald Games  

## 1. Executive Summary

Emerald Games is seeking a wireless networking solution for its office that delivers full coverage, modern security, and the capacity to support ongoing game development operations. This RFP outlines the technical requirements, scope of work, and expectations for vendors to help us build a secure, robust network we can build on should our needs change

## 2. About Us

We are an independent game development company focused on creating and promoting original indie games. Our first game, *The Last Conflict*, was released on Steam in 2017. Since then, we’ve been growing our team and expanding our technical foundation. We are now planning to upgrade our wireless network to ensure strong security and reliable performance across the office.

## 3. Project Scope

This project is about setting up a strong wireless network for the office at Emerald Games. We need something reliable, secure, and able to handle multiple users at the same time — especially since we're a game company and often use heavy internet resources like game builds, updates, and testing.

### Objectives
- Get solid wireless coverage everywhere in the office
- Use up-to-date tech like Wi-Fi 6
- Keep it secure so only the right people can connect
- Make sure it can handle lots of devices at the same time
- Set up tools so we can check the network and fix stuff fast

### Scope of Work
![Network Layout](./images/network.png)
- **Site Survey** – Walk through the office and figure out where to put the Wi-Fi access points so there’s no dead zones
- **Install & Setup** – Mount the access points and get them working with our settings (SSID, password, etc.)
- **Connect to Wired Network** – Make sure everything connects to the network we already have (LAN switches, router, etc.)
- **Security Setup** – Use WPA3, turn on MAC address filtering, and set up a guest Wi-Fi if needed
- **Test Everything** – Try out the network to make sure the speed is good and there are no weak spots
- **Basic Documentation** – Write down the setup in case someone needs to look at it later
- **Maintenance** – Keep the system updated and fix any issues that come up after installation

## 4. Requirements

- **Full Coverage** – Wi-Fi should be able reach all the rooms in the office, meeting areas, and open spaces
- **Wi-Fi 6 Support** – Must support the newest Wi-Fi standard so newer devices get full speed
- **Good Security** – Needs to have WPA3, MAC filtering, and maybe a separate network for guests
- **Handles Lots of Devices** – Should work fine with 20+ devices at once without slowing down
- **Monitoring Tools** – We need a way to see who’s connected, if anything’s wrong, and get alerts if stuff breaks

## 5. Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Technicians must provide a list of operating systems they know how to work with (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)

### Security & Compliance Requirements
- **Network Security** – List the Wi-Fi equipment you'd use (like Ubiquiti, Cisco, etc.) and a sample config (like how you set up SSIDs, VLANs, etc.)
- **Endpoint Security** – Share how you’ll protect the connected devices (firewalls, antivirus, etc.)
- **Data Protection** – Show how user and guest data will be safe (encryption, secure storage, etc.)
- **Regulations** – Follow GDPR, HIPAA, and any rules that apply to user data and privacy
- **Audits & Reporting** – Run regular checks and share reports on how secure everything is

## 6. Vendor Qualifications

### Experience
- Vendors should have at least 2 years of experience setting up wireless networks in office environments
- Vendors should be able to provide examples of past work that shows technical knowledge and ability to solve problems

### Project Approach
- Vendors should include 2 example projects they’ve worked on or ideas they would suggest for improving wireless networks for small offices

### Certifications
- Vendors must have at least one current certification in networking or security (e.g., CCNA, Network+, CWNA, or similar)
- Additional certifications in wireless, security, or cloud services are considered a plus

### References
- Vendors must provide at least 3 references from past clients who had similar wireless or network projects

## 7. Cost Breakdown (Rough Estimate)

| Item                          | Estimated Cost |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Wireless Router               | $250             |
| Site Survey                   | $200             |
| Installation & Setup          | $500             |
| Cabling (Ethernet to PCs)     | $100             |
| Maintenance (1 year)          | $450             |
| **Total**                     | **$1,500**       |

*Note: This setup is based on a small office environment with a single wireless router handling both wired and wireless devices. If future expansion is planned, access points and switching infrastructure can be added.*
